🎬 Netflix Dataset Analysis & Recommendation System
Welcome to the Netflix Dataset Analysis and Recommendation System project! This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the Netflix dataset of movies and TV shows up to 2019, sourced from the third-party search engine, Flixable. Our goal is to enhance user experience through a content-based recommendation system, ultimately reducing subscriber churn for Netflix, which currently serves over 220 million subscribers.

🚀 Project Overview
This project was meticulously carried out in a series of well-defined steps:

🧹 Handling Null Values

We addressed missing values to ensure data integrity and maintain the accuracy of our analysis.
🔄 Managing Nested Columns

Processed columns with nested data (e.g., director, cast, listed_in, country) for improved visualization and analysis.
🎯 Binning Ratings

The rating attribute was categorized into groups like adult, children’s, family-friendly, and not rated to streamline analysis and recommendations.
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Applied EDA techniques to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset, aimed at understanding user behavior to reduce churn.
📊 Creating Clusters

Utilized clustering techniques to group content based on attributes such as director, cast, country, genre, rating, and description. Tokenization, preprocessing, and vectorization were performed using the TF-IDF vectorizer.
🔻 Dimensionality Reduction

Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality, improving performance and removing noise.
🔗 Clustering Algorithms

Implemented both K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithms to create clusters. Evaluated the optimal number of clusters as 4 for K-Means and 2 for hierarchical clustering.
🤖 Content-Based Recommender System

Developed a recommender system using a cosine similarity matrix to offer personalized content suggestions, helping reduce subscriber churn.
📈 Results & Insights
This analysis and recommendation system not only offers valuable insights into the streaming entertainment industry but also serves to enhance user satisfaction through personalized content. The clustering and recommendation techniques used in this project are expected to improve subscriber retention for Netflix, contributing to its leadership in the streaming space.

💡 Conclusion
By conducting this comprehensive analysis and developing a content-based recommendation system, the project aims to:

Enhance user satisfaction.
Reduce subscriber churn.
Provide personalized content recommendations based on user preferences.
Help Netflix maintain its position as a leading streaming platform.
